## Docker Deployment

### Local Build and Run
1. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Open browser and go to: http://localhost:3003

### Stopping the Application
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Docker Configuration
The `Dockerfile` contains a multi-stage build:
1. **Build stage**: Install dependencies and build application
2. **Production stage**: Copy built application to production image

The `docker-compose.yml` file configures:
- Port mapping (3003:80)
- Volume mounting for logs
- nginx as web server

### Docker Security
Configuration includes:
- HTTP security headers
- Access rights limitation
- Image size minimization
- Non-root user usage

## Troubleshooting

### White Screen on Load
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Ensure resource paths in index.html start with "./", not "/"
3. Check that all necessary files were uploaded to GitHub Pages

### Resource Loading Errors (404)
1. Ensure the `distWebAuth` folder contains all necessary files
2. Check that GitHub Pages is configured for the correct folder
3. Ensure Vite configuration has `base: './'` parameter

### Routing Issues
If you use client-side routing, create a `404.html` file in the `distWebAuth` folder with the content of `index.html`:
```bash
cp distWebAuth/index.html distWebAuth/404.html
```

### Geolocation Errors
1. Check location permissions in browser
2. Ensure HTTPS is used (except localhost)
3. Check device privacy settings

### Telegram Authentication Issues
1. Ensure bot token is set in environment variables
2. Check that Web App URL is correctly configured in @BotFather
3. Ensure the application opens within Telegram

### Mobile Issues

#### Android
1. **Gradle sync failed**: Try "File" â†’ "Sync Project with Gradle Files" in Android Studio
2. **Build errors**: Check that you're using a compatible version of Android Studio and SDK
3. **Permission dialog not showing**: Ensure permissions are correctly declared in AndroidManifest.xml

#### iOS
1. **CocoaPods errors**: Run `cd ios && pod install` to update pods
2. **Signing errors**: Ensure your Apple Developer account is correctly configured in Xcode

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### "Port already in use"
```bash
# Find process using port
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
# Terminate process
taskkill /PID <process_number> /F
```

#### "Node.js not found"
1. Ensure Node.js is installed
2. Check that Node.js is added to PATH
3. Restart terminal after installation

#### "npm install fails"
1. Check internet connection
2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Try different registry: `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`

### Logging and Debugging

#### Local Development
Logs are displayed in the terminal where the server is running

#### Docker
View container logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Mobile Applications
1. Use Android Studio to view Android logs
2. Use Xcode to view iOS logs
3. Add console.log to code for debugging

## Application Updates

### Local Development
1. Get latest changes from repository
2. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Restart development server

### Docker (Production)
1. Get latest changes from repository
2. Rebuild and restart containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build
